## 🧠 About This Project

This project is a **responsive frontend clone** of the Amazon homepage.  
It replicates the **layout, style, and design** elements using only `HTML`, `CSS`, and a bit of `JavaScript`.

🧪 Built as part of my **practice and learning path** while starting out in frontend web development.
